## Commit 1 Reflection Notes  

Milestone 1 focuses on implementing a basic single-threaded web server in Rust. The process begins with setting up a new Rust project using `cargo new hello`, followed by initializing a Git repository and pushing the initial commit.  

The first implementation establishes a TCP listener using `TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878")`, which continuously listens for incoming connections. Whenever a client connects, the server prints `"Connection established!"` to the terminal. At this stage, the server does not process HTTP requests but only acknowledges connections.  

To enhance functionality, a `handle_connection` function is introduced. This function reads incoming HTTP requests using `BufReader` and stores them in a vector. Running the modified server allows the inspection of raw HTTP request headers when accessing `http://127.0.0.1:7878` from a browser, demonstrating how web requests are structured and processed at a low level.  

A key observation from this milestone is that a single-threaded server processes requests sequentially, meaning it can only handle one connection at a time. While functional, this approach has scalability limitations, which will be addressed in later milestones. This milestone establishes a foundational understanding of Rustâ€™s TCP networking capabilities and HTTP request handling.
